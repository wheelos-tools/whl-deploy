# whl_deploy

`whl_deploy` is designed to simplify the complex process of setting up Apollo. It ensures a smooth deployment by handling environment prerequisites and essential Apollo resources.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Host Environment Setup:** Get your host machine ready by installing Docker, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and applying necessary system configurations.
2.  **Resource Import & Deployment:** Seamlessly deploy all critical Apollo components, including the core container, source code, AI models, high-definition maps, and compiled cache files.
3.  **Resource Package Export (Helper):** Utilize this built-in function to create reusable resource packages, perfect for quick and consistent deployments in Step 2.
